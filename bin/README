    (1) replace_latex_accents.pl
        This script allows you to write special Hungarian and French characters in a simple way
        (using the ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) charset), then convert them to their LaTeX-equivalents.

    (2) replace_french_accents_to_latex.pl
        This script converts a French accented text to LaTeX replacing the funny characters
        with their LaTeX equivalents.
